  Hello and welcome to my website! I am a first-year master’s student in Harvard University’s Computational
  Science and Engineering program, where I am primarily studying topics in physics, machine learning,
  and materials science. As of spring 2026 I have joined the Materials Intelligence Research group (MIR) at
  Harvard SEAS under Professor Boris Kozinsky, where I will be working on applications of their NEquIP model
  for interatomic potentials. You can use this page to find my info and links, some selected projects from my
  coursework and research, and a potpourri of photos from my personal hobbies and interests. Outside of STEM
  work or research, I love camping and outdoor adventure (sometimes of the type II variety), and I am an avid
  bass player who is always looking for new people to make music with!

## Projects

Take a look at what I’ve been working on!

### Relaxed Equivariance for Anisotropic Noise

Final project for AMATH 226, Theory of Neural Computation.

Equivariant neural networks have been shown to be more data-efficient and generalizable than their
non-equivariant counterparts when the target function is known to be equivariant to some symmetry group.
Recent work has also shown that for some physical systems that have approximate symmetries, approximately
equivariant models can outperform both normal and strictly equivariant models, retaining state-of-the-art
performance on fully equivariant tasks. In this work, we test the effectiveness of relaxed equivariant
CNNs on a rotated MNIST classification task with added isotropic and anisotropic noise. We find that,
contrary to our hypothesis and previous work, the fully equivariant model outperforms both the relaxed
equivariant and normal CNN models in all noise settings.
