  Hello and welcome to my website! I am a first-year master’s student in Harvard University’s Computational
  Science and Engineering program, where I am primarily studying topics in physics, machine learning,
  and materials science. As of spring 2026 I have joined the Materials Intelligence Research group (MIR) at
  Harvard SEAS under Professor Boris Kozinsky, where I will be working on applications of their NEquIP model
  for interatomic potentials. You can use this page to find my info and links, some selected projects from my
  coursework and research, and a potpourri of photos from my personal hobbies and interests. Outside of STEM
  work or research, I love camping and outdoor adventure (sometimes of the type II variety), and I am an avid
  bass player who is always looking for new people to make music with!
