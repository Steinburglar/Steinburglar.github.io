  Hello and welcome To my website! I am a first year masters student in Harvard university's computational sciences and engineering degree, where I am primarly studying topics in physics, machine learning,
  and materials science. As of Spring of 2026 I have joined the Materials Intelligince Research group (MIR) at Harvard SEAS under professor Boris Kozinsky, where I will be working on
    applications of their NEquIP model for interatomic potentials. You can use this page to find my info and links, some select projects from my coursework and research, and a poupourri of photos from my personal hobbies and interests. Outside of STEM work or research, I love camping and outdoor adventure (sometimes of the type II variety), and I am an avid bass player who is always looking for new people to make music with!
